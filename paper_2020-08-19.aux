There are significant data-dumps, with New Jersey reporting over 1500 backlogged deaths when switching to include "probable" deaths. In some states, there appears to be a weekly cycle where deaths are under-reported on the weekend. This is especially pronounced for the U.S. as a whole. We can also see that there are some negative incident deaths, where data are revised to account for deaths that were incorrectly attributed to COVID. \relax }}{7}}

We can clearly see that the random walk is able to non-parametrically account for the non-pharmaceutical interventions retrospectively, with transmission dropping in states like New York quite rapidly. While it may seem that many states follow the same trend, this is slightly misleading since the prior pulls $\beta (t)$ upward for $t$ close to 0 in states that did not experience community transmission in March. B) Time varying case and death deviation model for example states. The time varying detection random walk is able account for the increase in testing and other reporting anomolies. There is remarkable similarity among the estimated case and death deviation model trajectories between states.\relax }}{17}}

We use the relative MAE metric which takes the MAE of MechBayes model and divides by the MAE of the baseline model. Here we can see that the MechBayes model improves in both MAE and coverage probability over time, consistently beating the baseline model in the month of July 2020. We can see that as the horizon increases from 1 to 4 weeks ahead, MAE, reflecting an increase in difficulty of forecasting further ahead in time. Note that targets averaging over forecast week include an average over all model versions. We also see a uniform improvement in coverage probability when broken down by timezero and target.
